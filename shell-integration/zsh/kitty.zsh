# This file can get sourced with aliases enabled. Moreover, it be sourced from
# zshrc, so the chance of having some aliases already defined is high. To avoid
# alias expansion we quote everything that can be quoted. Some aliases will
# still break us. For example:
#
#   alias -g -- -r='$RANDOM'
#
# For this reason users are discouraged from sourcing smelly.zsh in favor of
# invoking smelly-integration directly.

# ${(%):-%x} is the path to the current file.
# On top of it we add :A:h to get the directory.
